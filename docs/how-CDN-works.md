# How CDN Works

## What is a CDN?

A Content Delivery Network (CDN) is a network of servers distributed across multiple locations that work together to deliver content to users more efficiently. CDNs are designed to reduce latency, improve website performance, and provide a better user experience.

## How Does a CDN Work?

When a user requests content from a website, the request is routed to the nearest CDN server instead of the origin server. The CDN server caches the content and delivers it to the user, reducing the distance the content has to travel and improving the load time.
